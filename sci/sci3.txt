Critical Thinking Questions

1. Environmental Impact and Responsibility:
   - In the "Arbor Day" story, the students feel proud about planting trees and the benefits those trees will bring to the environment. Based on this, what do you think are some of the long-term responsibilities humans have toward the environment? How do these responsibilities compare to the way Owl Monkeys interact with their natural surroundings?

2. Behavioral Adaptations:
   - Owl monkeys have developed nocturnal habits, which set them apart from other primates. What environmental or survival advantages do you think have contributed to the owl monkey's nocturnal behavior? Compare this adaptation to how the students in the "Arbor Day" story adjusted their behavior to achieve the goal of planting trees.

3. Community and Collaboration:
   - In both readings, cooperation plays a significant role—whether it’s the students working together to plant trees or the owl monkeys communicating through calls and living in family groups. How do teamwork and communication benefit both human and animal communities? Can you think of examples where collaboration improves the outcome for a group or community in real life?
